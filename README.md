First project of the Data Science Bootcamp @WBS Coding School
# Sql-basic-and-advanced-challenges-solutions
 This is my first project for my Data Science Bootcamp at WBS Coding School.
We, as a group, had to explore some data from a company called "Magist" and
evaluate a possible Takeover by another company called "Eniac".
Our group decided for a pretty straightforward approach against a Takeover,
since the data clearly indicated that early on.
We learned to use:

SQL
Tableau The "Projeect-Dump" Folder contains some of the queries we wrote for the questions we had, some of them even remained answered/ got lost :D
